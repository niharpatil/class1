/*
"Variables" are like containers.
They can hold different "types". 
"Types" are in your toolbox for solving problems.
*/


// Types: Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Objects, Arrays, Functions

// Operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, concatenation

// Numbers


// Strings

// Booleans: types & logic

// var tastesLikeApples = true
// var isBubbly = true

// given drink ==> apple cider or apple juice



// Arrays: what are they? what are they good for? create, insert, access

// Objects: create, access, new fields, delete fields

// Functions: construct, return, undefined

// Equality

// Loops: for, while, iterate over strings, iterate over arrays

// If statements: if, else, else if

// High level idea of code execution: replacing variables, 1s and 0s
